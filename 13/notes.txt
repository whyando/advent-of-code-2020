I solved part 2 with an implementation of solving chinese remainder theorem (via extended euclidean), but it seems there is an some easier (although less efficient way in)

Straight brute force is way too slow, however there is a slight modification you can make:
1. Brute force until you have a solve for the first two buses.
2. Understand that this solution reoccurs precisely with period N*M where N,M are the IDs of the buses 
3. To get a solution for the next bus included, we jump forward N*M in each step of the brute force search, since this preserves the result for the
   previous buses
