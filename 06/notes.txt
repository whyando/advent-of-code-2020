Part 1:
A data parsing exercise

Part 2:
Trivial

notes:
Could be interesting to read each persons 26 question answers as an integer 0 <= x < 2^26
then part 1 becomes bitwise OR
and part 2 becomes bitwise AND

My preferred input format for this data would include an initial integer for the number of groups, and
then at the beginning of each group, an integer indicated the size of the group in advance, instead of newline
delimiting.
